# Spam Email Detection using Logistic Regression

This project aims to build a spam email detector using logistic regression. The model is trained to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) based on their content.

## Project Structure

- `spamEmailPrediction.py`: The main script for loading data, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- `spam.csv`: The dataset containing labeled emails.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hariThorve/SpamEmailDetection.git
    cd SpamEmailDetection
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```

3. Ensure the dataset [spam.csv] is in the project directory.
